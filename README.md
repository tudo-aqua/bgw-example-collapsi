# BGW Example: Collapsi

## Rules

Collapsi is a simple board game invented by Mark S. Ball in 2025.

The "living-rules" document of Collapsi can be
found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MV1vvV1Aq7ikRU7lF8Y7QQD-akH3ybHmk2fKs6p61lE/edit).
What follows is a brief summary for this version of Collapsi:

Collapsi is a game for 2-4 players. Players take turns moving their pawns across a square board
with fewer and fewer tiles to stand on. If a player can't make any legal moves, the tile below
them collapses and they're out of the game. The last player standing wins.

The tile a player is standing on at the beginning of their turn determines the number of steps
they need to take. That "starting tile" collapses as soon as the player takes their first step
each turn or if they can't make any legal moves. Collapsed tiles cannot be moved onto or moved through.
Pawns can wrap around the edges of the board. Pawns cannot move onto the same tile twice in
on turn. Pawns can move through other pawns, as long as they don't end their turn on an occupied tile.

2 players require a board of at least size 4x4. Each additional player requires one more column
and one more row.

Features:

- A match can be played locally or online (1 player per running application).
- You can substitute any local player with a bot with one of four levels of difficulty.
- Bot speed and animation speed can be controlled mid-game and bots can be paused.
- You can save and load local games.
- You can undo and redo individual steps in a local game.
